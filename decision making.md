* Frameworks: 
    1. solo
    2. consult and decide
    3. consensus based
* Process
  * Expectation setting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix#RAPID 
     * There must be only one decision maker, even when ownership is unclear. This individual should be the person most significantly affected by the outcome. If there's a misalignment between ownership and accountability, it indicates a flawed decision-making process that requires revision.
  * Engagement: involve individuals in the decisions that affect them to provide their inputs and encourage them to challenge on another's ideas.
  * Explanation: everyone involved and affected should understand why final decisions are made as they are.

* Learn when to say "no": 
  * All day, every day you will get requests, large and small. 
  * You can't say yes to everyone and everything and do it all well. 
  * You have limited amount of time and resources. By saying yes to one thing you are explicitly saying no to other things.
  * No one wants to disappoint or anger others. The most important thing in saying no is to do it in a way that makes people feel respected. 
    * Understand the ask: Insist on a well defined ask. It signals that you are taking the ask seriously, avoids misunderstanding and sending you off in the wrong direction. The bigger or more complicated the ask, the more information you should gather.
    * Explain why you are saying no: Say no to things that are 
        * not allowed: if there are rules and regulations that prohibits you from doing something, then give a straight no. You may be able to help the asker reframe the request within the rules so that it can then be considered.
        * cannot be done: If the ask is outside of your team's skillset you have two options: (a) say no, or (b) acquire the skils either through hiring or educating current staff and say not at the moment but later. If you are fully committed to other things and don't have bandwith to take on new work, you have two options (a) say no, or (b) re-engage with other stakeholders, reprioritize the stack to find room for the new ask. 
        * should not be done: if the likelihood of success is low, or the necessary resources are too great, or the ask is not aligned with your org's priorities, or the likely outcome is not desirable, you should say no, discuss your resasons with the asker as soon as possible and reach alignment. 
    * Don't silently drop the ball:  Always respond, and
    * Respond in a timely manner: while a precipitous no seems dismissive, don't string the asker along.
