* Bosses are neither a title on the organization chart nor a “function.” They are individuals and are entitled to do their work in the way they do it best. It is incumbent on the people who work with them to observe them, to find out how they work, and to adapt themselves to what makes their bosses most effective. This, in fact, is the secret of “managing” the boss. 
* The same holds true for all your coworkers. Each works his or her way, not your way. And each is entitled to work in his or her way. The first secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with and depend on so that you can make use of their strengths, their ways of working, and their values. Working relationships are as much based on the people as they are on the work.
* It is your responsibility to educate the people around you about your goals, what you do, how you work, your expectations from yourself and them. Even people who understand the importance of taking responsibility for relationships often do not communicate sufficiently with their partners.
* Your team's success and recognition depend significantly on your relationship with your management chain.

* Things your manager should know about you and similarly you should know about your reports:
   1. What problems you are working on and how you are trying to solve them
   2. You are making progress and you are not stuck
   3. What you prefer to work on 
   4. Your professional goals and growth areas
   5. How you believe you are being measured (Role rubric, KRs, KPIs, etc.)

* Things you should know about your manager, peers, and partners:
   1. What are their current priorities? 
   2. How stressed they are? How busy they are?
   3. Is there anything you can do to help?
