* Bosses are neither a title on the organization chart nor a “function.” They are individuals and are entitled to do their work in the way they do it best. It is incumbent on the people who work with them to observe them, to find out how they work, and to adapt themselves to what makes their bosses most effective. This, in fact, is the secret of “managing” the boss. 
* The same holds true for all your coworkers. Each works his or her way, not your way. And each is entitled to work in his or her way. The first secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with and depend on so that you can make use of their strengths, their ways of working, and their values. Working relationships are as much based on the people as they are on the work.
* It is your responsibility to educate the people around you about your goals, what you do, how you work, your expectations from yourself and them. Even people who understand the importance of taking responsibility for relationships often do not communicate sufficiently with their partners.
