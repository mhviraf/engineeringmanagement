* Almost every internal problem can be traced back to a missing or poor relationship. With great relationships it's possible to come together and solve almost anything.

* You have four important set of relationships to establish and nurture over time
    * Up (manager and skip level manager)
    * Down (reports)
    * Left (peers)
    * Right (partners)

* Accept the fact that other people are as much individuals as you yourself are. They perversely insist on behaving like human beings. This means that they too have their strengths; they too have their ways of getting things done; they too have their values. To be effective, therefore, you have to know the strengths, the performance modes, and the values of your coworkers.

* An exercise i find helpful in practicing judgment is to predict what happens in meetings in advance then update my priors based on the delta between my predictions and reality. a couple questions i ask myself: what issues do I expect to arise? who will take which position?
