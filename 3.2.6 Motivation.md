* Carrot and stick methods (reward and punishment) are ineffective for truly motivating people. Using those methods, the employees will move but the motivation is the company/manager's. The next time you want them to move again you have to show them carrot / stick again. They are extrinsic motivators. Until you activate employees' own generators you will be stuck with trying to recharge their batteries yourself again and again. 
* Intrinsic motivators
    * Purpose
    * Achievement (making progress toward purpose)
    * Recognition
    * Ownership & autonomy
    * Growth & mastery
* Most high performing employees are motivated by more than money. They seek the satisfaction of work well done. Coercive management style erodes such pride. 
* One of the best tools in a manager's toolkit to motivate people is to show them how their work fits into a grand, shared mission.
