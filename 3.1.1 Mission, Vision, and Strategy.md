Mission == the why

Vision == they what (aspirational, long term, illustrative and directional)

* If a ship doesn't know where it sails, no wind will be favorable. 


Strategy == the how (practical, variable term, accurate and detailed)

* A good strategy has three key components
   - diagnosis: a theory desribing the challenge at hand
   - policies: general approaches to address the challenge, often tradeoffs between two or more competing goals
   - actions: translating policies into specific steps to implement them
* Strategies are specific to a given problem. Hence, it's ok and encouraged to write quite a few of them. The act of writing a strategy doc leads people through a systematic analysis so even if we don't share them, these documents help us work through problems both overwhelming and mundane. 
* The most challenging part of writing a practical strategy almost always includes people and organizational aspects that are uncomfortable to acknowledge. No extent of artistry can solve a problem that you're unwilling to admit.
