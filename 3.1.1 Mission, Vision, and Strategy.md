Mission == the why

Vision == they what (aspirational, long term, illustrative and directional)

* If a ship doesn't know where it sails, no wind will be favorable. 
* Unlike strategies, visions describe a future in which tradeoffs are no longer mutually exclusive. You should write from a place far enough out that the error bars of the uncertainty are indisputably broad, where you can focus on the concepts not the particulars. Visions should be detailed, but the details are used to illustrate the dream vividly, not to prescriptively constrain its possibilities. 
* Lithmus test: you'll know a vision is succeeding if people reference the document to make their own decisions, and it's struggling when decisions keep happening that don't fit into its direction. 
* Visions need to be refreshed annually, based on the guiding principle of usefulness not consistency. if the current vision no longer resonates, it's ok to start over; it's a sign that you've learned a lot of the past year. 
* Vision docs, are a leadership tool and a solution to a specific set of problems. If your teams are aligned and doing good work, time spent writing these won't be too valuable but if your team is struggling to align with stakeholders, or if you're struggling to lead a cohesive organization, these documents are exceptionally useful. 


Strategy == the how (practical, variable term, accurate and detailed)

* A good strategy has three key components
   - diagnosis: a theory desribing the challenge at hand
   - policies: general approaches to address the challenge, often tradeoffs between two or more competing goals. It's like a signpost, marking the direction forward but not defining the details of the trip. 
   - actions: translating policies into specific steps to implement them
* good strategy works by focusing on one or a very few pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes. a long list of "things to do" is not a strategy. such lists usually grow out of planning meetings with a wide variety of stakeholders. in recognition that team cant do everything, the label "long-term" is then added. 
* major hallmarks of bad strategy:
   - fluff
   - failure to face the challenge: when you cannot define the challenge, you cannot evaluate the strategy or improve it
   - mistaking goals for strategy: many bad strategies are statements of desire rather than plans for overcoming obstacles. they are long on goals. short on policies and actions. 
* Strategies are specific to a given problem. Hence, it's ok and encouraged to write quite a few of them. The act of writing a strategy doc leads people through a systematic analysis so even if we don't share them, these documents help us work through problems both overwhelming and mundane.
* The most challenging part of writing a practical strategy almost always includes people and organizational aspects that are uncomfortable to acknowledge. No extent of artistry can solve a problem that you're unwilling to admit. 
* good strategy requires leaders who are willing and able to say no to a wide variety of actions and interests. strategy is at least much about what an organization does not do as it is about what it does .
