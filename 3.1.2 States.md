Every team can be categorized into one of the four states below. Teams want to climb from falling behind to innovating while entropy drags them backward.
1. Falling behind: backlog grows continously. users are vocally dissatisfied. The system solution in this state is typically to hire net new people, increase the capacity until the team moves into treading water. Provide tactical support by setting expectations with users, beating the drum around the easy wins, and injecting optimism. 
2. Treading water: critical work gets done but unable to pay off tech debt, or take on major new projects. Typical solution in this state, is to consolidate efforts to finish more things and to reduce number of concurrent work until team is able to repay debt. 
3. Repaying debt: For a team that has just gotten out of falling behind, and treading water into repaying debt, stakeholders are probably antsy waiting for the team to start delivering new stuff. Your obligation is to prevent that impatience from causing a backslide. Each piece of debt you repay leads to more time to repay more debt (debt repayment snowball).
4. Innovating: tech debt is sustainably low and morale is high. Team has enough time to experiment with new ideas and to innovate in order to satisfy new user needs.
