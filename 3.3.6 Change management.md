* Change initiatives have two stages: conception and implementation. Failure often occures at the second stage.

* Once you have reached a decision to make radical changes, you need change agents to adopt and spread them. The following people are your best candidates
   * early volunteers: seek help from everyone at all levels. you will find likeminded people that are excited sbout the change
   * positive critics: by addressing their concerns you would not only get their buy in but also bullet proof your change idea. Don't confuse positive critics with inveterate naysayers though. 
   * people with informal power: every organizarion has individuals whose power and influence exeeds far betond their formal authority and whose help and advice are highly sought after by people all around them
   * versatile inviduals: people who have voluntarily adapted major changes in the past are more likely to become early adopters

* Radical change can stir up high levels of fear. Uncertainty about change can deflate morale and trigger anxiety that, unchecked, can degenerate into paralysis. 

* Big changes appear to happen in a moment but they're usually a slow accumulation of small changes.
