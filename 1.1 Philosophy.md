* Philosophy: You get paid by your employer to add value to its customers through managing a team of people.
* Goal: __Your singular job is to maximize ROI of the business__. If you deliver outstanding results with integrity you will succeed. If you deliver mediocre results and get everything else right, you will fail. 
* Success metric: ROI of the groups under you _and_ under your influence.
* Most important responsibility: identifying the highest leverage opportunities, devising a coherent approach to achieving them, and delivering them in a timely manner. 
* Maximizing ROI doesn't always mean minimiznig cost; if you see opportunity to deliver 2.1x results at 2x cost you should go after it.

* Management is a job title, leadership is a trait hence you can be a leader without being a manager, and vice versa. Leadership being a positive trait I find it odd when managers self-proclaim as leaders. True leadership should be recognized by others rather than self-declared.
