* One-on-ones are engineer's meetings to talk about what's on their mind. It's not a meeting for project updates.
* Start with weekly meetings and adjust the cadence based on the need.
* At the meetings
   * Set the tone: Be present. Start out with energy and optimisim. It's not merely another task on your already long list; something to just get done. 
   * Listen more than you talk: your report must talk for 50% to 90% of the meeting. Listen actively; display genuine interest without judgement and acknowledge the employee's viewpoint even if your diasgree with it. Stay vigilant about your body languange and reactions to ensure that you are creating a welcoming and safe space.
   * Feedback: 1:1s provide an excellent opportunity for you to give honest and specific feedback on your report's perspectives or actions. See [feedback.md](feedback.md) for more details.
   * Be flexible: Despite having an agenda going into each 1:1, allow the conversation to move organically as needed to provide value. Also, consider each person's preferences regarding communication, collaboration, etc. and adjust your approach accordingly. What's comfortable for one direct report may not be so for another.
