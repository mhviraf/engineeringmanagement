* important questions to ask yourself 
     * what are your strengths? What results are you skilled at generating? 
     * what are your weaknesses? we all have _a wast number of areas_ in which we have no talent or skill and even little chance of becoming mediocre. 
     * how do you work most effectively? Do you process information most effectively by reading it, or by hearing others discuss it? Do you accomplish the most by working with other people, or by working alone? Do you perform best while making decisions, or while advising others on key matters? Are you in top form when things get stressful, or do you function optimally in a highly predictable environment?
     * what are your values? What are your ethics? What do you see as your most important responsibilities for living a worthy, ethical life? Do your organization’s ethics resonate with your own values?
     * where do you belong? in what kind of environment do you fit in best? 


* Our intentions do not fully control our thoughts. We become acutely aware of this when we are unable to suppress undesired ruminations about risk, desease, and death. A great deal of human thought is not intentional. It just happens. Hence, it's important to think about your own thinking. 
* judgment begins with knowing yourself, your abilities and biases. then it extends to knowing others.
* good judgement is hard to define and harder still to acquire. nonetheless, it can be improved by practicing; through feedback analysis. write down what you expect to happen when you make key decisions or take key actions, then compare the actual results with your expectations. ask why your expectations were or were not met. kinda like how neural networks update its weights. one sample at a time. over time as you repeat this enough times you will start to see patterns of strength and growth opportunities. 
* one technique I really like for identifying growth areas is monitoring problems you'd naturally gravitate towards and those you try to avoid. we tend to want to work on problems we are good at and run away from those that require growth because of the added pain. 

* Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to succeed. But work hard to improve the way you perform. And try not to take on work you cannot perform or will only perform poorly.
