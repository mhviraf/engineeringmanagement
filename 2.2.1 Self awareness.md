* Our intentions do not fully control our thoughts. We become acutely aware of this when we are unable to suppress undesired ruminations about risk, desease, and death. A great deal of human thought is not intentional. It just happens. Hence, it's important to think about your own thinking. 
* judgment begins with knowing yourself, your abilities and biases. then it extends to knowing others.
* good judgement is hard to define and harder still to acquire. nonetheless, it can be improved by practicing; through feedback analysis. write down what you expect to happen when you make key decisions or take key actions, then compare the actual results with your expectations. ask why your expectations were or were not met. kinda like how neural networks update its weights. one sample at a time. over time as you repeat this enough times you will start to see patterns of strength and growth opportunities. 
* one technique I really like for identifying growth areas is monitoring problems you'd naturally gravitate towards and those you try to avoid. we tend to want to work on problems we are good at and run away from those that require growth because of the added pain.
