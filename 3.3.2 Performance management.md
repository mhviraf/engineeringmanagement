* Managing performance is a manager's job not HR's.
* low performance could almost always be attributed to either lack of skills or lack of motivation:
    * Motivation [see Motivation.md]
    * Training
        - Give resources, then time, look for signs of improvement
        - Pair with someone whose strengths are complementory to the IC's weaknesses
* Managing out options
  - Find another team at the company if it's a great IC but not a good fit for the team
  - Manage out of company
