* Philosophy: You are being paid by the company to add value to your team's customers through managing a team of people.
* Success metric: output of the groups under you __and__ under your influence. 
* Management is a job title, leadership is a trait i.e. you can be a leader without being a manager, and vice versa. Leadership being a positive trait I find it odd when managers self-proclaim as leaders. True leadership should be recognized by others rather than self-declared.
