There are four fundamental team topologies:
1. Stream-aligned teams
  * A "stream" is a continous flow of work aligned to a business domain or organizational capability.
  * This type (as the primary team type in an organization) of team is aligned to a single, valueable stream of work: single product or service, single set of features, a single user journey, etc.
  * Mandate should be build and deliver customer value independently without requiring handoffs to other teams to perform parts of the work ("you build it, you run it"). 
  * By necessity, closer to the customer, and able to quickly incorporate feedback from customers while monitoring software in production. 
  * Should be funded in a long-term, sustainable manner as part of a portfolio or program of work, not as a fleeting project.
2. Platform teams
3. Enabling teams
4. Complicated-Subsystem teams
