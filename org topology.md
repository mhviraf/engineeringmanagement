* Org charts are always out of sync with reality, much like a software architecture document soon after actual development starts. 
* For ICs, reorgs can bring a lot of fear, doubt and uncertainty because it breaks down established forms of communication and splits up teams and ICs that were just starting to get their mojo. Often, it's seen as a time and effort drain that is more likely to set the business back than to move it forward. 
* Excessive amount of responsibilities and domains may lead to too much congnitive load for a team, and consequently lack of bandwidth to pursue mastery of their trade and struggles with the costs of switching context. Ultimately, the team becomes a delivery bottleneck, leading to delays, quality issues, and often a decrease in team members' motivation (See Intrinsic motivators in [Motivation](motivation.md))
