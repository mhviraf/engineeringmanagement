## Scaling consistent decision making
* In small organizations it's easy for individuals to be aware of what others are doing and how they previously approached similar problems. This hive mind and memory create consistent decision making that leads to quality output. However, as the organizations grow, they often slide into incosistent decision making. Common approaches to address inconsistency creep include formalized sprints, training, documentation, processes for particular decisions such as incident reviews. When the problem becomes truly accute, folks eventually reach out for the same tool which is addiing a centralized, accountable group. The two most common flavors of this are "product reviews" to standardize product decisions and the "architecture reviews" to encourage consistent technical design.  
* Design:
    * influence: how do you expect this group to influence the results? will they primarily work through advocacy or will they make binding decisions?
    * interface: how other individuals interact with this team? depending on the kind of influence, and org culture, you'll want to play around with different approaches 
    * size: how large should the group be? if its ~6 or less, it's possible for them to jell into a true team, one whose members know each other well, work together closely, and shift a significant portion of their individual identities into the team.  the larger the group, the more responsibility becomes diffuse, and the more you'll need to have specified roles within the group.
    * time commitment: you'll want more time commitment (and hence higher contribution) for areas where folks are directly impacted by the consequences of their decisions and lower for scenarios with weaker feedback loops.
    * identity: should members primarily identify as members of their existing teams or their role in the decision making group?
    * selection process: having a structured selection process where you identify the requirements and the skills you need then allow folks to apply often works better than authoritatively hand picking a few.
    * representation: attention to this can help you avoid blind spots such as missing front-end engineers during product reviews or missing infra folks during architecture reviews. 
* failure modes
    * domineering: decision making group significantly reduces individuals' freedoms and becomes churn factories. This happens most often when those making decisions are abstracted from the consequences of their decisions e.g. architecture groups where members write little to no code.
    * bottlenecked: group is generally helpful but is trying to do more than they're able to. these groups get worn down, and either burn out their members or create a backlog to avoid burning out, which ends up seriously slowing down folks who need their authority.
    * status-oriented: group places more emphasis on being a member of the group than the group's nominal purpose. the value of the group revolves around recognition rather than contribution. 
    * inert: groups whose members have not jelled or are too busy tend to not do much of anything.
