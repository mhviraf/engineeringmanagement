* Challenges to learning
    * Lack of psychological safety: Psychological safety is critical to promoting a learning environment. To learn, you must first acknowledge that there are things you don't understand.
    * Information Islands: Knowledge fragmentation that occurs in different parts of an organization that don't communicate with one another or use shared resources. In such an environment, each group develops its own way of doing things. This leads to information fragmentation, duplication and skew (different ways of doing the same thing that may be in conflict with each other).
    * Single point of failure: when critical information is available from only a single person
    * Parroting: Mimicry without understanding
    * Haunted graveyards: Places often in code that people avoid touching because they are afraid that something might go wrong.
