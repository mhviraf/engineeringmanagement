* Org charts are always out of sync with reality, much like a software architecture document soon after actual development starts. 
* For ICs, reorgs can bring a lot of fear, doubt and uncertainty because it breaks down established forms of communication and splits up teams and ICs that were just starting to get their mojo. Often, it's seen as a time and effort drain that is more likely to set the business back than to move it forward. 
* Excessive amount of responsibilities and domains may lead to too much congnitive load for a team, and consequently lack of bandwidth to pursue mastery of their trade and struggles with the costs of switching context. Ultimately, the team becomes a delivery bottleneck, leading to delays, quality issues, and often a decrease in team members' motivation (See Intrinsic motivators in [Motivation](motivation.md))
* If the architecture of the system and the architecture of the organization are at odds, the architecture of the organization wins ([Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)). Thus, we need to understand what software architecture is needed _before_ we organize our teams. Hence, organizational design requires technical expertise. They are two sides of the same coin, thus both need to be undertaken by the same group of people. 
* Use small and durable teams as the standard building blocks of the organization. Teams should be stable but not static, changing only occasionally and when necessary. 
* The team owns the software. Team ownership provides the vital continuity of care that modern systems need. A problem of everyone is a problem of no one. The danger of allowing multiple teams to change the same system is that no one owns either the change or the resulting mess.
