## General philosophy
* Embrace failure. Failure is an inevitable part of everyone's journey. What's important in handling failures is extracting lessons from each experience and implementing changes in our processes to prevent similar setbacks in the future.
* You must have monitoring and alerting in place to detect failures as soon as possible and at the lowest-value-added points in your pipeline.
* Team's psychological safety is crucial for effective failure management. If team members perceive a zero-tolerance attitude towards mistakes, they'll be reluctant to report failures. This creates a culture of concealment that can lead to more severe problems down the line.

## Common failure modes of managers
* __Spending too much time on underperformers__. Remember that by saying yes to something you are effectively saying no to something else. Spending that time on highperformers typically have a much higher return for the team. 
* __Being nice over being candid__. Having hard conversations is part of your job. For example withholding critical feedback from an underperforming employee in an attempt to be kind actually does them a disservice. They may only discover these issues later, when it's too late to address them effectively.
