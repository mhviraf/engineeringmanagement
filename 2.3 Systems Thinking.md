* Key points
    * Stop fighting symptoms. Ask: what structure is producing this behavior?
    * Look for loops, delays, and unintended consequences.
    * Intervene at deeper leverage points (rules, goals, paradigms).
    * Cultivate resilience, self-organization, and clarity of purpose and remember that systems often behave in counterintuitive, nonlinear ways.
* systems are everywhere. the world isn't just a bunch of isolated parts; it's interconnected. managers are not confronted with problems that are independent of each other, but the dynamic situations that consist of complex systems of changing problems that interact with each other; people, processes, incentives, deadlines, quality, culture, etc.
* a system = elements + interactions + purpose
* behavior comes from structure. the way a system behaves isn’t random. it’s shaped by the feedback loops and delays built into it. change the structure (not just the symptoms), and you change the behavior.

* leverage points (places in the system where a small shift can make a big difference): don’t just push harder at the surface e.g. when bug count is rising you could push engineers harder (symptom), or you could look deeper maybe incentives reward speed over quality (system structure). changing the reward system is a stronger leverage point.
    * constants, parameters, numbers (weakest leverage) e.g. adding 2 more engineers or bumping spring velocity targets. they are sometimes necessary but don't change the system's structure. 
    * buffers: extra slack to absorb shocks e.g. redundant servers or buffer in roadmaps.
    *  stock-and-flow structures: e.g. in a hiring pipeline, redesigning the pipeline itself (& say reducing interview bottlenecks) often has more impact than just "working harder".
    * delays: hiring more people doesn’t instantly increase output, there’s a ramp-up delay. a change in process might feel like “nothing’s happening” for months, then suddenly the effect shows up.
    * reinforcing (virtuous) loops e.g. every time your team ships faster, leadership trusts them more, so they get more autonomy, which makes them move even faster.
    * balancing (vicious) loops e.g. more autonomy might also trigger mistakes, which slows shipping, which reduces trust.
    * information flow: who gets what info, and when? e.g. if incident data is siloed in SRE, dev teams repeat the same mistakes.
    * rules of the system e.g. “no code merges without tests” -> reshapes engineering habits. rules are powerful leverage points, but people will often work around them (rule beating).
    * self-organization e.g. allowing teams to choose their own tools or workflows instead of mandating everything top-down, increases resilience and innovation.
    * goals of the system e.g. “maximize feature delivery” vs. “maximize sustainable customer value.”
    * mindset/paradigm (the deepest leverage point) e.g. if the org sees QA as “policing devs” you get tension loops. if the mindset shifts to “QA is our safety net” the same process yields collaboration.
* system traps: 
    * policy resistance: different parts of the system push against each other, so the whole thing doesn’t move e.g. Product pushes for more features, Security pushes for fewer risks, Infra pushes for stability. Everyone’s goals clash, so the result is stalemate and frustration.
    * drift to low performance: expectations get lowered each time performance slips, until mediocrity becomes the norm e.g. “We know our releases will be buggy, that’s just how it is.”
    * escalation: two sides try to outdo each other and everyone loses. 
    * success to the successful: the more resources one part of the system gets, the more it succeeds, which justifies giving it even more resources; starving the rest. 
    * shifting the burden e.g. whenever a crisis hits, seniors jump in -> juniors don’t get the chance to build skill, so dependence on seniors grows -> system becomes brittle (bus factor risk). to escape this trap, you invest in mentorship or slow down now, so the system’s capacity grows later.
    * rule beating: people follow the letter of the rule but undermine its spirit e.g. if management rewards velocity metrics, teams might close Jira tickets in creative ways to “look fast” while actual throughput doesn’t improve.
    * seeking the wrong goal: the system chases a proxy metric that doesn’t actually represent the true goal e.g. optimizing for “story points completed” instead of “customer value delivered.” Teams look productive but customers don’t feel it.
* characteristics of a healthy system:
    * resilience: can absorb shocks and keep going
    * self-organization: can adapt without top-down control
    * heirarchy: subsystems are nested, but don’t choke feedback
    * clear boundaries: where you draw the system boundary changes what story you see. our mental models often oversimplify or mis-slice the system.


* there is no single legitimate boundary to draw around a system. We have to invent boundaries for clarity and sanity and boundaries can produce problems when we forget that we've artificially created them
