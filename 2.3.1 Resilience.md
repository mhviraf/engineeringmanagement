* Never let a disaster go to waste.
* In a chess game there is always a best next move, even when you know that you are loosing.
* Resilience can be learned
   * Instead of slipping into denial to cope with hardship, take a sober view of the reality of the situation. Lying to yourself is never productive.
   * Resist any impulse to view yourself as a victim. 
   * Set goals to go from N to N+1 to construct meaning for yourself and others, even if N is 100 times smaller than what it was yesterday. 
   * Be inventive. Make the most of what you have, putting resources to unfamiliar uses, and possibilities others don't see.
