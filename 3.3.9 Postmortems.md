* document your failures in post mortems. 
* they must not be a useless list of excuses and apologies.
* every post mortem must have
    (1) what happened, 
        * brief summary of the event
        * a timeline from discovery until resolution
        * the primary root cause
        * impact and damage assessment
    (2) what was learned, and 
    (3) what is going to change as a result and by when and who.
