* Philosophy: You get paid by your employer to add value to your team's customers through managing a team of people.
* Goal: __Your singular job is to maximize ROI of the business__. It doesn't always mean minimiznig cost; if you see opportunity to deliver 2.1x results at 2x cost you should go after it. 
* Success metric: ROI of the groups under you _and_ under your influence. 

* Management is a job title, leadership is a trait i.e. you can be a leader without being a manager, and vice versa. Leadership being a positive trait I find it odd when managers self-proclaim as leaders. True leadership should be recognized by others rather than self-declared.
