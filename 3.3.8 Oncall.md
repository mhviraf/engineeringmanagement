* There are two camps for how to run oncall

| Approach | Schedule | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|---------|----------|------|------|----------|
| **1. Everyone owns everything** | Weekly rotation (each person takes a turn) | Predictable schedule, maintained focus | Less context on specific systems, possible lack of ownership | Teams managing a small number of systems or suffering from lack of focus time |
| **2. Whoever writes code, owns it too** | Ad hoc, ~10â€“15% ongoing time commitment | Strong accountability, better long-term system health, discourages cutting corners | Unpredictable workload, harder to maintain focus | Teams managing many systems or aiming to improve code ownership culture |

* Shared rotations to pool multiple teams could work as intermediate steps toward teams owning their own oncall rotations. Not a good long term solution as unfamiliar systems could be disproportionately stressful for engineers. 
* As a rule of thumb, it takes 8 engineers on a team to support a two-tier oncall rotation.
