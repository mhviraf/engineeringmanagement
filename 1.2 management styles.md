Despite the common belief, leadership style is not a function of personality but rather a strategic choice of one or more from the following styles, depending on the situation; or building a team with members who employ the styles the manager lacks.

| Style | Manager's mode of operation | In one sentence | Suitable for | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Coercive | Demands immediate compliance | Do what I say | (Use with extreme caution when it's absolutely imperative) Turnaround situation, disaster management, working with problem employees with whom all else has failed. It can break failed business habits and shock people into new ways of working | Inhibits organization's flexibility and dampens employees' motivation and sense of ownership and they'd feel little accountability for their performance | 
| Authoritative | Mobilizes people toward a vision but gives people freedom to choose their own means of achieving it | Come with me | Most situations but specially when business is adrift | Doesn't work when team is more experienced than the manager | 
| Affiliative | Creates harmony and builds emotional bonds | People come first | Building team harmony, increasing team morale, improving communication, and repairing broken trust | Exclusive focus on praise can allow poor performance to go uncorrected and often leave employees in quandary. Could be a great combination with authoritative style but if overly relied on this style can steer a team to failure. | 
| Democratic | Forges consensus through participation | What do you say? | Building organizational flexibility and responsiblity, and generating fresh ideas. Not suitable for when employees not competent or informed enough to offer sound advice. | Endless meetings and confused people who feel leaderless | 
| Pacesetting | Sets a high standard for performance | Do as I do, now. | Getting quick results from a highly motivated and competent team | Other employees tend to feel overwhelmed and resent leader's tendency to take over a situation. Evaporates responsibility and trust. | 
| Coaching | Develops people for the future | Try this | Improving employees' performance and developing long term strength | Doesn't work well when employees are not aware of their weaknesses and are resistant to changing their ways |
