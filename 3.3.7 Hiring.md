* Hiring is a manager's job not recruiters'.
* Every quarter assess alignment between the skill sets of the team and the demand to identify gaps you need to hire for.  
* In a hypergrowth setting, productively integrating large number of engineers is challenging and it's primarily a factor of how quickly you can ramp up new engineers as well as the efficacy of the hiring pipeline. Imagine training a new engineer takes 10h/week from their spinup buddy and an untrained engineer is only .33x productive. In that worldview if you are doubling the size of the team your team will be only 54% productive for the duration of ramping up new engineers. The 4% could be easily spent on interviewing. Hence, despite doubling the team size, don't expend higher throughput in the short term.
