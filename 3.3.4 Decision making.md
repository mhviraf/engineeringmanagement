* Managers are responsible for all the decisions made in their teams, full stop. that does not of course mean they should make all the decisions.
* Decision-making is at the core of our personal and professional lives. For managers, it’s one of the most important skills, if not the most important. You can spend countless hours refining how you make decisions, and it’s absolutely worth every minute.
* No one makes the right decision 100% of the time. Failure is inevitable. Enormously important decisions made by intelligent and responsible people with the best information and intentions are sometimes hopelessly flawed. See 3.2.7 Failure. 
    * A decision will be made at some point based on some data and assumptions. as new data comes in, contexts change, or assumptions get dispelled, it might become clear that a decision was in error or it made sense at the time but no longer does. 
* Don’t judge the quality of a decision solely by its outcome. Buying a pizza instead of 100 bitcoins in 2011 may seem unwise in hindsight, but given the information and context at the time, it was a reasonable choice.
* Indecision is the worst decision. 
* Don't fall into the trap of indecision-framed-as-frairness. It's not fair if no one gets anything.
* Compromise: 
   * When the truth is knowable (e.g., measurable facts), don't compromise, seek out the evidence.
   * When the truth is unknown, opt for disagree and commit. Once a decision is made, despite disagreement, even skeptics must fully support it.
   * Resort to compromise only as a last measure when consensus can’t be reached and uncovering the truth isn’t feasible.
* Frameworks: 
    1. solo: most effective for turnovers or disaster management under extreme urgency. 
    2. consult and decide: most common framework
    3. consensus based
* The process
  * Clarify ownership: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix#RAPID 
     * There must be only one decision maker.When ownership is unclear, this individual should be the person most significantly affected by the outcome. If there's a misalignment between ownership and accountability, it indicates a flawed decision-making process that requires revision.
  * Define the problem clearly: State what needs to be solved and why it matters. Ensure everyone agrees on the problem before debating solutions.
  * Gather information: 
     * involve individuals in the decisions that affect them to provide their inputs
     * Compile a list of alternatives. Strive for breadth of input rather than unanimous agreement at this stage.
     * Encourage constructive challenge to surface risks and trade-offs of approaches.
  * Make the decision: Avoid endless debate, clarity beats consensus when speed is required.
  * Explanation: everyone involved and affected should understand why final decisions are made as they are. Transparency helps build trust even when not everyone agrees with the outcome.

* Learn when to say "no": 
  * All day, every day you will get requests, large and small. 
  * You can't say yes to everyone and everything and do it all well. 
  * You have limited amount of time and resources. By saying yes to one thing you are explicitly saying no to other things.
  * No one wants to disappoint or anger others. The most important thing in saying no is to do it in a way that makes people feel respected. 
    * Understand the ask: Insist on a well defined ask. It signals that you are taking the ask seriously, avoids misunderstanding and sending you off in the wrong direction. The bigger or more complicated the ask, the more information you should gather.
    * Explain why you are saying no: Say no to things that are 
        * not allowed: if there are rules and regulations that prohibits you from doing something, then give a straight no. You may be able to help the asker reframe the request within the rules so that it can then be considered.
        * cannot be done: If the ask is outside of your team's skillset you have two options: (a) say no, or (b) acquire the skils either through hiring or educating current staff and say not at the moment but later. If you are fully committed to other things and don't have bandwith to take on new work, you have two options (a) say no, or (b) re-engage with other stakeholders, reprioritize the stack to find room for the new ask. 
        * should not be done: if the likelihood of success is low, or the necessary resources are too great, or the ask is not aligned with your org's priorities, or the likely outcome is not desirable, you should say no, discuss your resasons with the asker as soon as possible and reach alignment. 
    * Don't silently drop the ball:  Always respond, and
    * Respond in a timely manner: while a precipitous no seems dismissive, don't string the asker along. 
* A one-way door decision is hard to reverse, so tread carefully; a two-way door opens both ways so decide fast and adapt faster.

* Your priority should be company, team, then yourself; in that order. Always start from a company perspective. 
    * I am a believer in users first principle. However, I think the company’s success is inseparable from serving users well. Hence company>team>individual still holds.

* There has to be a reason for everything. "just because", "because I said so", "because everyone else does it this way" are places where bad decisions lurk in.
    * It's expected to see some instance of "I don't agree with you, _but I see how you can come to that conclusion_.
    * sometimes decisions are based on instinct or accepted best practices, but only after we have exhausted approaches that try to measure or estimate the true underlying costs.
