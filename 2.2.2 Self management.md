* You are what you do, not what you say youâ€™ll do.

* Mood: good moods galvanize performance but it doesn't make sense to be as chiper as a blue jay at dawn when the business is going under. Display moods and behaviors tha match the situation at hand. 

* Continous learning: 
   * Opportunities: if you want to have unlimited learning opportunities, don't limit yourself to learn only from people that are smarter than you, or who you like, etc. Be humble. You can learn something from anyone.
