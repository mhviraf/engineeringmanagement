* Frameworks: 
    1. solo
    2. consult and decide
    3. consensus based
* Process
  * Expectation setting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix#RAPID 
     * There must be only one decision maker, even when ownership is unclear. This individual should be the person most significantly affected by the outcome. If there's a misalignment between ownership and accountability, it indicates a flawed decision-making process that requires revision.
  * Engagement: involve individuals in the decisions that affect them to provide their inputs and encourage them to challenge on another's ideas.
  * Explanation: everyone involved and affected should understand why final decisions are made as they are.
