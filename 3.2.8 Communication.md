* good communication is the connective tissue between everything you do as a manager.

* being able to communicate clearly, candidly, and empathetically helps you form strong relationships which in turn forms strong teams. 

* manage your energy - be mindful of your own mood: some conversations may leave you feeling happy, angry, frustrated, etc. if you come out of a meeting frustrated you may be carrying that frustration into the next meeting; that means you may end up making somebody else feel that you're annoyed at them or worse even transfer that frustration to them.
