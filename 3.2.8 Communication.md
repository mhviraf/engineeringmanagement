* good communication is the connective tissue between everything you do as a manager.

* being able to communicate clearly, candidly, and empathetically helps you form strong relationships which in turn forms strong teams. 

* Don't hide and don't let members of your team hide. you need to make sure that everyone's working on the right thing, doing it correctly and their work hasn't been done before. chances of early misstep are high. the more everyone communicates, and seek feedback, the more you lower this risk. 

* manage your energy - be mindful of your own mood: some conversations may leave you feeling happy, angry, frustrated, etc. if you come out of a meeting frustrated you may be carrying that frustration into the next meeting; that means you may end up making somebody else feel that you're annoyed at them or worse even transfer that frustration to them.

* how you communicate shouln't be about you. it should be about them. adapt yourself for the benefit of others. 
## Upward communication
* Ownership with context, not excuses: Executives want confidence that someone has the problem under control, even if the outcome isn’t great yet. Own results end to end, explain the context succinctly, and focus on what’s changing because of it. Avoid defensive narratives. “Here’s what happened, here’s what we learned, here’s what we’re doing differently” goes a long way.

## Downward communication
* as a manager your word carries weight. it can be interpreted as a command or feedback. in carpentry theres a proverb: measure twice cut once because you can't uncut. think twice before talking.
