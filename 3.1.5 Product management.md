* Most engineering orgs separate engineering and product leadership into distinct roles. However, best EMs I've worked with knew how to be a 70% PM and vice versa. Additionally, at times e.g. your PM's departure or running a new team, as the engineering leader you need to temporarily cover both roles. Following is the typical split between the two but the overlap in the venn diagram in an effective companyis huge
   * PMs focus on what the team builds and why
   * EMs focus on the how. 
* Product management is a complex role worthy of its own repository but at a high level it can be reduced to the following for problems
   1. Exploration
      * Users pain and purpose: what are the problems that users experience and what motivates them to engage with the product?
      * Competition: how your product compares to competitors. What are your advantages and disadvantage? What are your moats (extereme version of competitive advantage)?
      * Compounding leverage: What thing you could build today that would compound into major product or technical leverage over time?
   2. Selection
      * See [Eisenhower prioritization matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#Eisenhower_method)
      * On top of urgency and importance, you gotta factor risks and costs into your prioritization
   3. Validation: before moving to execution phase, spend time upfront validating the narrowed down problem set
      * Write a first draft of shipped email and see if you are able to write something exciting, useful and real for your users?
      * Identify prior art: the fact that others have solved a problem in a certain way doesn't mean that it's the best way but it does at least mean there exists a possible solution.
      * Prefer experimentation over analysis
